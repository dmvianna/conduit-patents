"1999042436","ABSTRACT: A method for effecting direct reduction of iron oxides in the form of lumps or pellets, in which an ore burden is passed downwardly successively through prereduction and metallization zones of a shaft furnace while passing a flow of rich fuel gas produced by external partial combustion upwardly in counter current through the prereduction zone, and, passing a flow of reducing gas in cocurrent though the metallization zone. The flow of reducing gas is an independent flow that has not been subject to external combustion, and an intermediate zone is provided forming a narrowed throat between the prereduction and metallization zones. The 15 reducing gas is introduced at a boundary between the intermediate and metallization zones, such that passage of rich fuel gas from the prereduction zone to the metallization zone is inhibited. The gas flows should be controlled so that about 5% to 10% of the volume of 20 reducing gas passes upwardly from the intermediate zone to the prereduction zone. *foe"

"1999042454","ABSTRACT A plug assembly for plugging boreholes includes an expandable main body having an internal chamber therein, and a pressurised container operatively mounted to the main body. The pressurised container includes a discharge outlet and an actuator operable to open the discharge outlet. The pressurised container contains an expandable working fluid therein which is pressurised so that the working fluid within the container includes a liquid component which partially fills the container. The plug assembly is capable of adopting a first working mode wherein the liquid component of the working fluid within the pressurised container is adjacent the discharge outlet and second working mode wherein the liquid component of the working within the pressurised container is spaced from the discharge outlet. The arrangement is such that operation of the actuator causes the discharge outlet to open and the working fluid passes into the internal chamber of the main body and expands so as to thereby cause expansion of the main body. 1\ \119' FIGURE 1 FIGURE 3 21 FIGURE 2 FIUR FIGURE 4"

A second rotational element (28) is housed within the first element (22) and is rotatable about the same axis to drive a second rotational output (30). A first fluid chamber (31) is associated with the first rotational element (22) and first regulating means (35) to varies the volume of the first chamber (31) in response to rotation of the first rotational element (22). A second fluid chamber (32) is associated with the second rotational element (28) and second regulating means (36) varies the volume of the second chamber (32) in response to rotation of the second rotational element (28). A commutator (33) at least regularly establishes a closed fluid flow communication between the first and second chambers (31, 32) during rotation of the first and second rotational elements (22, 28). The relative timing of variation of the volumes of the first and second chambers (31, 32) determines the speed of rotation of the second rotational element (28) in response to rotation of said first rotational element (22).

"1999042503","Abstract Disclosed is a method and apparatus for inserting a data signal into an audio signal to provide a tagged signal. The method includes removing a band of frequencies centre at a predetermined notch frequency from the audio signal, spectrally shaping the data signal so that it takes on the precise shape and magnitude of the envelope of the audio signal at the removed band, and inserting the shaped data signal into the removed band of the audio signal. The method may be used to identify an audio segment or it may be used to encode the audio signal with other desired data. The method of the invention provides for the data signal to be virtually inaudible to the listener of the audio segment yet robust enough to survive severe audio signal processing.

Also disclosed is an apparatus for diagnosis of a mood disorder or predisposition therefor, use of the diagnostic method in genetic linkage studies for the identification of the molecular defect(s) underlying these disorders, and for the identification of compounds which may alleviate such disorders.

A first member (3) is between the centre shaft (1) and the cage (6) for communicating movement there between, and a second member (7) is between the cage (6) and the outer body (5) for communi cating movement therebetween. Upon rotation of one said component (shaft, cage or outer body) at least one of the remaining components is caused to rotate. The output from one component (shaft, cage or outer body) is such that variation of a load between zero and a maximum value corresponds to variation of the ratio of the angular velocity be tween the other two or more components. This variation is achieved by a second input or brake (10).
